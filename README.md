statistics system for raspberry pi

unstable!

This is a statistical system raspberry focused (or systems with limited resources)

The advantage regarding other statistical systems, is that this only collects data, and external server takes care of the rest, and avoid having apache, mysql, php ... on the machine you want to monitor.
